I am **NOT** a coder. Much of the code posted here could likely use optimization. I don't know what a "pull request" is, and I likely cannot answer any code-related questions. Contributions to improve and optimize the code here is welcome and appreciated, but again, I'm not a coder and don't understand how GitHub actually works.
