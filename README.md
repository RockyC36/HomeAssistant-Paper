# 🏠 Home Assistant: Paper Dashboard

This is my personal custom dashboard for Home Assistant used in my home.

Posted here both as a backup and for others to use.  I am **not** a coder or designer, just a Linux hobbyist who loves Home Assistant.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Realtime status of devices
- 🔔 Custom alerts and automations
- 📱 Responsive mobile layout

This dashboard uses hidden entity badges that only appear on update, info, or fault conditions - kind of like a dashboard lights on a car (see the photo). Clutter and information overload is banished while still being useful. It also uses different colors to denote update, info, error, or fault conditions in line with the badges. Entity states for water use, EV charging, my pond pump, and a few other things also use colors.

## Add-Ons This Dashboard Uses

## 🙌 Contributing

I am **NOT** a coder. Much of the code posted here could likely use optimization. I don't know what a "pull request" is, and I likely cannot answer any code-related questions. Contributions to improve and optimize the code here are welcome and appreciated, but again, I'm not a coder and don't understand how GitHub actually works.
