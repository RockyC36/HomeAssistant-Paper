# 🏠 Home Assistant: Paper Dashboard

This is my personal custom dashboard for Home Assistant used in my home.

Posted here both as a backup and for others to use.  I am **not** a coder or designer, just a Linux hobbyist who loves Home Assistant.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 Realtime status of devices
- 🔔 Custom alerts and automations
- 📱 Responsive mobile layout

This dashboard uses hidden entity badges that only appear on error, fault, or update conditions. (see the photo) 

It also uses different colors to denote entity states for water use, EV charging, and my pond pump. 

## Add-Ons This Dashboard Uses
- [Mushroom Cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom)
- [Card Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)
- [Clock Weather Card](https://github.com/pkissling/clock-weather-card)

## 🙌 Contributing

I am **NOT** a coder. Much of the code posted here could likely use optimization. I don't know what a "pull request" is, and I likely cannot answer any code-related questions. Contributions to improve and optimize the code here are welcome and appreciated, but again, I'm not a coder and don't understand how GitHub actually works.
